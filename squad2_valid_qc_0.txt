 land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important 
literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a g
reat fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formida
ble principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their uniqu
e Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments
 and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II 
, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the
 Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England. Norman cultural
 and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near Ea
