primary context:
Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football Leagu
e (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated
 the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super B
owl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area 
at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniv
ersary" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of nam
ing each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as "Super B
owl L"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.
