The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even t
he Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian pie
ty, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo
-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaun
d or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by trea
ty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was f
orged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for t
heir culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their sig
nificant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily 
under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on 
behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of 
Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to t
he Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antio
ch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Afr
ica and the Canary Islands.

 harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with
 the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle b
