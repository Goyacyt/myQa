Robert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as
 the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. Having
 obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign co
nquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After 
allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 m
en in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikum
i), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquere
d Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these
 harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with
 the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle b
ecause it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had se
cured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a
 high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted 
until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merch
ants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Io
annina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of
 Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dy
rrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.

Robert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as
 the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. Having
 obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign co
nquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After 
allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 m
en in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikum
i), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquere
d Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these
 harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with
 the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle b
ecause it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had se
cured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a
 high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted 
until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merch
ants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Io
annina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of
 Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dy
rrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.
