------------test case82------------
primary context:
The Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking bre
thren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England 
across the English Channel. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the m
arriage of Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England. Because of 
this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard. His
 stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after Cnu
t the Great's conquest of the isle.

 archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford. He invited his brother-in-law E

conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex.
