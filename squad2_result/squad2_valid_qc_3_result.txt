primary context:
Before Rollo's arrival, its populations did not differ from Picardy or the Île-de-France, which were
 considered "Frankish". Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided bet
ween colonies in the east (Roumois and Pays de Caux) around the low Seine valley and in the west in 
the Cotentin Peninsula, and were separated by traditional pagii, where the population remained about
 the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents who raided and ultimately settled Nor
mandy and parts of the Atlantic coast included Danes, Norwegians, Norse–Gaels, Orkney Vikings, possi
bly Swedes, and Anglo-Danes from the English Danelaw under Norse control.
