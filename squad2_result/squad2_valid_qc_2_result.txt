In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the 
rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal prop
erty. The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint
-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was s
ituated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French 
lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further
 Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to
 the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was rou
ghly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of G
allia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).
