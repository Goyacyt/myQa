primary context:
The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th a
nd 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse ("
Norman" comes from "Norseman") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their
 leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of as
similation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants woul
d gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and eth
nic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continue
d to evolve over the succeeding centuries.
