All biomass goes through at least some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, ferme
nted, distilled, and burned. All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total a
mount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting etha
nol fuel is known as the energy balance (or ``energy returned on energy invested''). Figures compile
d in a 2007 report by National Geographic Magazine point to modest results for corn ethanol produced
 in the US: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting
 ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one un
it of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not eas
ily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a
 separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical climat
e to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended, as compared to c
orn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended. A 2006 Uni
versity of California Berkeley study, after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing
 ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline.

primary context:
Property tax or 'house tax' is a local tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is and impo
sed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It
 resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested 
in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and coll
ection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupie
d and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applyi
ng a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government p
roperties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of
 foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompa
nied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, al
l using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the ur
ban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first tw
o brackets.

In mathematics, parity is the property of an integer's inclusion in one of two categories: even or o
dd. An integer is even if it is evenly divisible by two and odd if it is not even. For example, 6 is
 even because there is no remainder when dividing it by 2. By contrast, 3, 5, 7, 21 leave a remainde
r of 1 when divided by 2. Examples of even numbers include −4, 0, 82 and 178. In particular, zero is
 an even number. Some examples of odd numbers are −5, 3, 29, and 73.
