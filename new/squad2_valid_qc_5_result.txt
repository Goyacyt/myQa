Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sasso

general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans—formerly of Oursel—led by Raimbaud. They even lent their 
ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning "Franks." The known trade between Amalfi and
