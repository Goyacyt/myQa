primary context:
One of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was Hervé in the 1050s. By then 
however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as Trebizond and Georgia. They we
re based at Malatya and Edessa, under the Byzantine duke of Antioch, Isaac Komnenos. In the 1060s, R
obert Crispin led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. Roussel de Bailleul even tried to carve o
ut an independent state in Asia Minor with support from the local population, but he was stopped by 
the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos.

primary context:
Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sasso
un and Taron in far eastern Anatolia. Later, many took up service with the Armenian state further so
uth in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains. A Norman named Oursel led a force of "Franks" into the uppe
r Euphrates valley in northern Syria. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian 
general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans—formerly of Oursel—led by Raimbaud. They even lent their 
ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning "Franks." The known trade between Amalfi and
 Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities
 while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.
