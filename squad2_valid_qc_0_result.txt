  The Norman dynasty had a major political
   cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East
   The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety
   becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated
   They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled
   their dialect becoming known as Norman
   Normaund or Norman French
   an important literary language
   The Duchy of Normandy
   which they formed by treaty with the French crown
   was a great fief of medieval France
   and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure
   The Normans are noted both for their culture
   such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions
   and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations
-  Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines
+  Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II 
   and an expedition on behalf of their duke
   William the Conqueror
-  led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066
